# Interpreter
Interpreter implementation in C++ language
## What is Interpreter:
An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.

An interpreter generally uses one of the following strategies for program execution:
1) Parse the source code and perform its behavior directly;
2) Translate source code into some efficient intermediate representation and immediately execute this;
3) Explicitly execute stored precompiled code made by a compiler which is part of the interpreter system.
